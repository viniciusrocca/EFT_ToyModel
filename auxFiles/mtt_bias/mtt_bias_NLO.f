c This is a user-defined function to which to bias the event generation.
c A non-flat distribution will generate events with a certain weight
c inversely proportinal to the bias_wgt. This is particularly useful to
c generate more events (with smaller weight) in tails of distributions.
c It computes the bias_wgt factor from the momenta and multiplies the
c weight that goes into MINT (or vegas) with this factor.  Before
c writing out the events (or making the plots), this factor is again
c divided out. A value different from 1 makes that MINT (or vegas) does
c not list the correct cross section, but the cross section can still be
c computed from summing all the weights of the events (and dividing by
c the number of events). Since the weights of the events are no longer
c identical for all events, the statistical uncertainty on this total
c cross section can be much larger than without including the bias.

c The 'bias_wgt' should be a IR-safe function of the momenta.
c      
c For this to be used, the 'event_norm' option in the run_card should be
c set to
c      'bias' = event_norm

c How to enhance the tails is very process dependent. For example for
c top quark production one could use:
c      do i=1,nexternal
c         if (ipdg(i).eq.6) then
c            bias_wgt=sqrt(p(1,i)**2+p(2,i)**2)**3
c         endif
c      enddo
c Or to use H_T^2 one does     
c      H_T=0d0
c      do i=3,nexternal
c         H_T=H_T+sqrt(max(0d0,(p(0,i)+p(3,i))*(p(0,i)-p(3,i))))
c      enddo
c      bias_wgt=H_T**2
      return
      end
